                <p>I am a full-stack developer currently enrolled in the full-time bootcamp at Rutgers University! I come from an extensive background of biology and healthcare. I graduated from Oakland University with a B.S. in Biomedical Science in May 2021, and worked in clinical medicine for four years. I am interested in creating applications for use in healthcare or STEM! I am very knowledgeable in both the healthcare and biological research industries.</p>
